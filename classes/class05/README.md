4. By now, [we hope you've read through](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html) Chapter 2 of *The Signal and the Noise* and four sections of *How to be a modern scientist*.
5. The Project 1 Proposal is due at 9 PM Monday 2021-03-01.

"The point of the pipe is to help you write code in a way that is easier to read and understand." The pipe is sometimes read as " ... and then ... " as a way of facilitating this thinking...
