## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's Slides are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class03/432_2021_slides03.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class03/432_2021_slides03.Rmd).
- All 432 classes are video-recorded, and the recordings will be archived in the Zoom section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Reminders

- The [Minute Paper after Class 03](http://bit.ly/432-2021-minute-03) is due Wednesday 2021-02-10 at noon. 
    - It should take about 5 minutes. Remember to log into Google via CWRU to [access the form](http://bit.ly/432-2021-minute-03).
    - Please complete these Minute Papers in a timely fashion even if you haven't yet caught up with us in class.
    - The [complete schedule of Minute Papers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/minutepapers/README.md) is available.
- *Reading*: We expect you to have read the introduction and Chapter 1 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* as well as the Data-Sharing and Reading scientific papers sections of Jeff Leek's *How to be a modern scientist* by now. (Of course, some of this was in Lab 1.)
    - We won't be discussing these pieces each week, but we will catch up with them irregularly through the semester, and in Labs and Quizzes.
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs/lab02) is the next substantial assignment, due at 9 PM on 2021-02-22.
- Were I you, I would take advantage of the relative lull coming up this weekend in 432 work to look closely at the requirements of [Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/project1) and in particular, the [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md) which is due on 2021-03-01. 
    - It's never too early to get started, and finding an appropriate data set is not something you want to put off until the end of the month.

## Need some suggestions for attractive data for 432 projects?

*Note*: I've added this information to the [Project 1 main page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/README.md), too.

Five especially appealing sources that I'd really like to see people use for Project 2 are:

1. The [Health and Retirement Study](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products/access-to-public-data)
2. The [General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/)
3. The many many public use data sets available at [ICSPR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/)
4. The [500 Cities and PLACES data portal](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities+%26+Places&sortBy=newest&utf8), most probably I would focus on the [County-level data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb).

Other sources students have used successfully in the past and that Iâ€™m happy to see include:

5. [National Center on Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/ftp_data.htm) including NHANES
6. [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm)
7. [County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation)
8. [Kaggle Public Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) but only those with really useful variables, no hierarchical structure and strong descriptions of how the data were gathered (which is at best 5% of what's available on Kaggle).

- If you have any doubt at all about whether a data set would work or whether we'll find it to be acceptable, drop in to [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/contact.html) and show it to us, or (if that's not possible) send us a note about it on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432).
- Don't type "regression data sets" into Google. That will lead you to data sets we've seen before, and don't want to see again.
- I encourage those of you who used NHANES data last Fall in 431 to use something else (just so that you can get familiar with some new data), but those of you who really want to may benefit from some [advice from the 431 class about using NHANES data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectB/your2.html) in a different project. Note that your rules are different, but most of the advice still holds well.

## from [rstudio::global(2021)](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021) 

Today, I'll share Ahmadou Dicko's inspiring 19-minute talk [Humanitarian Data Science with R](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/humanitarian-data-science-with-r/). 

- Ahmadou Dicko is a statistics and data analysis officer at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) where he uses statistics and data science to help safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees in West and Central Africa.
