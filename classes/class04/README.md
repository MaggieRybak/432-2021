## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's Slides will be [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class04/432_2021_slides04.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class04/432_2021_slides04.Rmd).
    - We'll pick up where we left off in Class 3. I've incorporated the key parts of what we did then into this new deck.
- All 432 classes are video-recorded, and the recordings will be archived in the Zoom section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Visit [the Minute Paper page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/minutepapers) for the link to Dr. Love's feedback to the Minute Paper after Class 03.
2. A new monthly Zoom lecture series on social determinants of health, led by my colleague Dr. Ash Sehgal at [MetroHealth](https://www.metrohealth.org/) and the [Institute for H.O.P.E.](https://www.metrohealth.org/institute-for-hope) starts soon. [This two-page flyer](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class04/figures/SDOH_Seminar_Series_2021_March_and_April.pdf) describes the sessions and speakers for 2021-03-01 (Laura Gottlieb) and 2021-04-05 (Rishi Manchanda).

## from [rstudio::global(2021)](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021) 

Today, I'll share Kara Woo's terrific 22-minute talk [Always look on the bright side of plots](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-plots/). 

- Everyone who creates visualizations in R is bound to make mistakes that prevent their plots from looking as they should. Sometimes, these mistakes create beautiful "accidental aRt", though other times they're just plain frustrating. Either way, however, there's something to be learned.

## Reminders

1. A reminder to take advantage of the relative lull coming up this weekend in 432 work to look closely at the requirements of [Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/project1) and in particular, the [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md) which is due on 2021-03-01. See our [comments in the Class 3 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/classes/class03) on this subject.
    - It is never a bad idea to run a project data set past Dr. Love and/or the TAs via Piazza or Office Hours. 
    - To quickly assess your data, we need to know the data source (including a URL where we can see the data) and we need to know what variables you're intending to use as outcomes, and the variables you intend to use as predictors.
2. [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs/lab02) is the next substantial assignment, due at 9 PM on 2021-02-22.
