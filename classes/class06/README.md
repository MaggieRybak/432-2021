## Announcements

- I have not completed my review of the Minute Paper after Class 5. I will get this out as soon as possible.
- Remember [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs/lab02) is due Monday at 9 PM.
- The Project 1 Proposal is due at 9 PM Monday 2021-03-01. 
    - We suggest you identify [an acceptable data set](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/00_project1_general.md#3-what-makes-an-acceptable-data-set) and ingest it into R before next week at this time to be sure you can complete the proposal by the deadline. 
    - Here are [some suggestions for data sets](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/project1#need-some-suggestions-for-attractive-data-for-432-projects). 
    - If you like, you can [run a project idea by us by sending us these five pieces of information about it](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/project1#running-a-data-set-past-us-for-project-1) on Piazza or discussing them in office hours, but that's not mandatory.
