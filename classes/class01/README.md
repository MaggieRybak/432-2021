## Questions (with Answers) from the "[Welcome to 432 Survey](http://bit.ly/432-2021-welcome-survey)"

If you haven't taken the survey already, please [do so today](http://bit.ly/432-2021-welcome-survey).

1. How is Dr. Love feeling?
    - I am fine, in the 2021 sense that I am essentially healthy and my family is, as well, and those of us who were employed last February still are. On the other hand, I am anxious most of the time, and certainly not functioning at full capacity. I hope you'll be patient with me.
    - With regard to the upcoming semester, I am hopeful that we can deliver an effective course, and that we can connect with each of you in a helpful, supportive way. I am very grateful for our teaching assistants, who do a lot to keep me moving forward and I am extremely grateful. Please let us know if we can help you along the way.
2. Has Dr. Love been vaccinated against COVID-19?
    - Not yet. Nor has my mother, or anyone else in my family. I look forward to that miraculous occurrence.
    - Some of our teaching assistants work for health systems and have been vaccinated, as have many of my colleagues at Metro. I am very grateful that is true.
3. How did Dr. Love spend his holiday season?
    - With my wife and two children, in the house. We watched a fair amount of stuff on the internet, and did a lot of crossword puzzles and spelling bees, and ate, a lot.
    - My older son has now returned to his off-campus apartment in Pittsburgh for his last semester of undergraduate education and his part-time job at the Carnegie Museum.
    - My younger son continues to do his first year of college (Columbia University) at home, which is not what anyone wants, but he's a good roommate.
4. Are there multiple students who did not take 431 this past Fall?
    - Yes, about a half dozen, I think.
5. (from a student who did not take 431 with us in the Fall) Are there any specific parts of 431 that we should review and pay special attention to and that will be integral to succeeding in 432? 
    - I expect the most obviously useful elements will be the discussion of specific R packages and functions related to working with linear models. It would also be helpful to look at the lab assignments and project requirements and tips from 431 since we build on that knowledge in the 432 materials. [The R-basics document](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/r-basics) from the 432 R and Data menu is certainly worth some of your time, too.
