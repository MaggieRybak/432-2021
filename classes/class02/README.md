# Two Last Things

- Jānis Stūris at [Data Cornering](http://datacornering.com/) had a nice post back on 2020-01-01 of [My favorite RStudio tips and tricks](http://datacornering.com/my-favorite-rstudio-tips-and-tricks/) some of which would definitely save me some time and energy. Jānis produces lots of useful tips, and I encourage you to take a look.
- In a similar vein, you might also be interested in [6 RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U373PGg8Y_0) on YouTube, or if you prefer, just [read the article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/01/6-life-altering-rstudio-keyboard-shortcuts/).
- Perhaps my favorite RStudio tip is to hit F7 for spell-check. Another thing I use a lot is [this PDF of Colors in R](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
