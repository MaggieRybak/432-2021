## A little bit of inspiration

In each of the next few class READMEs, I've decided to spend a moment sharing one of the many great talks from the recent [rstudio::global(2021)](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021) conference. Today, I'll share Alex Cookson's 5-minute talk [The Power of Great Datasets](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/the-power-of-great-datasets/). 

- I hope Alex will motivate you to curate Great Datasets and perhaps explore something you're not currently thinking about for a project or other activity to develop your statistical or programming skills.

1. To come.

## One Last Thing - RStudio Tips

- Jānis Stūris at [Data Cornering](http://datacornering.com/) had a nice post back on 2020-01-01 of [My favorite RStudio tips and tricks](http://datacornering.com/my-favorite-rstudio-tips-and-tricks/) some of which would definitely save me some time and energy. Jānis produces lots of useful tips, and I encourage you to take a look.
- In a similar vein, you might also be interested in [6 RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U373PGg8Y_0) on YouTube, or if you prefer, just [read the article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/01/6-life-altering-rstudio-keyboard-shortcuts/).
- Perhaps my favorite RStudio tip is to hit F7 for spell-check. Another thing I use a lot is [this PDF of Colors in R](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
- When working with tidyverse and similar packages, I'm forever opening the [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), as well.
