# 432-2021

This will be the main public repository for the 2021 version of the 432 course (PQHS 432, CRSP 432 or MPHP 432) to be led by Professor Thomas E. Love at Case Western Reserve University.

The main web page for the course in Spring 2021 is https://thomaselove.github.io/432/, and that's your best starting point.

Extensive materials will appear here before the start of the course on 2021-02-02, and will continue to be updated during the semester.

Contact Dr. Love at `thomas dot love at case dot edu` if you have any questions.
