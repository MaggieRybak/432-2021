# Project 1 for 432 in Spring 2021

This is the main page for Project 1. 

## Instructions

1. [Start here with General instructions for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/00_project1_general.md). Project 1 includes two Tasks.
2. Next, visit the [Specific instructions for Task 1 (The Proposal)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md).
    - This includes details on the required data cleaning and exploratory work, and is what you'll be working on in February.
3. Next, review the [R Markdown templates for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/templates/README.md) and select one to use for your work on Task 1 and (later) on Task 2.
    - Using one of these templates will help you complete Project 1's two Tasks in ways that will be attractive, organized and easy for us to review.
4. Finally, look at the [Specific instructions for Task 2 (Analyses and Presentation)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/02_project1_analyses.md) so you have a better sense of what is coming.
    - This includes data analyses and presentation work, and is what you'll be working on in March.

All deadlines for projects are specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).
