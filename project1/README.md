# Project 1 for 432 in Spring 2021

This is the main page for Project 1. 

## Instructions

1. [Start here with General instructions for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/00_project1_general.md). Project 1 includes two Tasks.
2. Next, visit the [Specific instructions for Task 1 (The Proposal)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md).
    - This includes details on the required data cleaning and exploratory work, and is what you'll be working on in February.
3. Next, review the [R Markdown templates for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/templates/README.md) and select one to use for your work on Task 1 and (later) on Task 2.
    - Using one of these templates will yield results that are attractive, organized and easy for us to review. Please use them.
    - There is also a [(draft) rubric we'll use in evaluating your proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.pdf), which should help you get through the Proposal stage efficiently.
4. Finally, look at the [Specific instructions for Task 2 (Analyses and Presentation)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/02_project1_analyses.md) so you'll know where you're heading.
    - This includes data analyses and presentation work, and is what you'll be working on in March.

All deadlines for projects are specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Need some suggestions for attractive data for 432 projects?

Five especially appealing sources that I'd really like to see people use for Project 2 are:

1. The [Health and Retirement Study](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products/access-to-public-data)
2. The [General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/)
3. The many many public use data sets available at [ICSPR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/)
4. The [500 Cities and PLACES data portal](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities+%26+Places&sortBy=newest&utf8), most probably I would focus on the [County-level data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb).

Other sources students have used successfully in the past and that Iâ€™m happy to see include:

5. [National Center on Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/ftp_data.htm) including NHANES
6. [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm)
7. [County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation)
8. [Kaggle Public Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) but only those with really useful variables, no hierarchical structure and strong descriptions of how the data were gathered (which is at best 5% of what's available on Kaggle).

- If you have any doubt at all about whether a data set would work or whether we'll find it to be acceptable, drop in to [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/contact.html) and show it to us, or (if that's not possible) send us a note about it on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432).
- Don't type "regression data sets" into Google. That will lead you to data sets we've seen before, and don't want to see again.
- I encourage those of you who used NHANES data last Fall in 431 to use something else (just so that you can get familiar with some new data), but those of you who really want to may benefit from some [advice from the 431 class about using NHANES data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectB/your2.html) in a different project. Note that your rules are different, but most of the advice still holds well.
