# 432 Project 1 Templates

We have provided three templates to make it easier to meet the requirements of Project 1.

There are three styles, each of which is a good choice as far as we are concerned.

## Task 1 (Proposal) Templates

- Floating Table of Contents Style
- HTML Clean Style
- Readthedown Style

## Task 2 (Final Presentation) Templates

The Task 2 templates just add three additional sections (Linear Regression Modeling, Logistic Regression Modeling, and Discussion) to the Task 1 templates.

- Floating Table of Contents Style
