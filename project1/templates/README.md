# 432 Project 1 Templates

We have provided three templates to make it easier to meet the requirements of Project 1.

There are three styles, each of which is a good choice as far as we are concerned.

## Task 1 (Proposal) R Markdown Templates

Style | R Markdown Template | See the HTML Result
---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------
Floating Table of Contents | [R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/templates/proj1_proposal_template_floatingTOC.Rmd) | [View HTML](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/proj1_floatTOC_432)
HTML Clean | [R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/templates/proj1_proposal_template_htmlclean.Rmd) | [View HTML](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/proj1_clean_432)
Read The Down | [R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/templates/proj1_proposal_template_readthedown.Rmd) | [View HTML](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/proj1_readthedown_432)

### Highlight: How R code is presented

In each of the templates, there's an option to change the highlight style, which just changes how the R code is presented.

- Supported highlight styles include default, tango, pygments, kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn, haddock, breezedark, and textmate. If you like, try making a change and see if you prefer the results.

### Themes (for the Floating TOC template)

- The theme command in the YAML specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the [Bootswatch theme library](https://bootswatch.com/3/)). Valid themes include default, cerulean, journal, flatly, darkly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti. Again, feel free to try alternatives to see if you like them.

Just make sure I can read the result easily.

## Task 2 (Final Presentation) Templates

The Task 2 templates just add three additional sections (Linear Regression Modeling, Logistic Regression Modeling, and Discussion) to the Task 1 templates. Grab those R Markdown files at the links below, or just add the three new sections yourself to your completed Task 1 document.
