# References and Resources for 432 in Spring 2021

This is just a repository of references I expect to use or refer to during the semester. Some items are password-protected. The password is revealed in the first class session.

All of these items will be linked through [Class READMEs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/classes), as well, as they become useful to us.
