432 Lab 06 for Spring 2021
================

Last Updated: 2021-02-05 17:18:21

Note that this Lab is **completely optional**.

-   If you wish to do it, it needs to be completed (by sending an
    Dr. Love via email with the subject line: `432 Lab 06: My Website`
    no later than the deadline specified on [the Course
    Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).
    -   This lab doesn’t use material from the 432 class sessions, so
        you can do it at any time, including right now.
-   If you already have a web presence that is working well for you, you
    are welcome to revise it in light of some of the guidance provided
    here, but this is really designed for people who have no current
    presence online.
-   If you are a student in the MS or PhD program in PQHS, I earnestly
    hope you will take advantage of this opportunity.

## What are we doing?

Your task is to build a web presence for yourself on the Internet using
R Markdown, and specifically a tool called `blogdown`, **or** an
analogous tool, if you prefer.

-   [A new version of
    blogdown](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/01/18/blogdown-v1.0/)
    (version 1.0) was posted to CRAN on 2021-01-18.
-   The [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is
    currently under revision to account for the many improvements that
    are now in place with blogdown 1.0.
-   One good model for what we’re going for is [this one from Wyatt
    Bensken](https://wyattbensken.com/) (who is now a third year PhD
    student in Epidemiology & Biostatistics and TAd for 431 last Fall.)
-   Another good model is [this one from our current TA Anastasia
    Vassiliou](https://anastasiavassiliou.netlify.app/) built for the
    class last Spring.
-   Additional examples built by your colleagues can be [found
    here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab06/examples.md)

One appealing strategy is to include results from your class projects as
projects on your website. That’s up to you.

-   [Wyatt posted a YouTube
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBxCk7P9wqE&feature=youtu.be)
    describing his motivation for doing the work. He also [wrote a blog
    post describing his approach to building his
    site](https://wyattbensken.com/post/building-website/) which is a
    strong starting point.
    -   Here’s [Dan Quintana’s 2018 YouTube
        video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox_Ue9yzf-0) on “How to
        make a personal academic website for free using R and the
        blogdown package” which is certainly worth a look. [Dan’s 2019
        tutorial](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/)
        is one of Wyatt’s key references.
    -   In 2020, [Dan’s updated
        guide](https://www.dsquintana.blog/create-an-academic-website-free-easy-2020/)
        switches to an alternative approach for building your site. If
        you want to use that approach instead, great.
-   Again, the most detailed source is [blogdown: Creating Websites with
    R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) which describes a
    lot of available options, but like the rest of these documents, is a
    little out of date with the changes in blogdown 1.0.
-   Alison Hill’s [Up & running with blogdown in
    2021](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/) may be
    helpful to you.
-   Emily Zabor’s
    [tutorial](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html)
    might be of some help to you, as well, if you’re looking to create a
    website just using R Markdown (and perhaps some Github.)

**Note** If you find a helpful resource for using blogdown to build a
personal website other than those listed above, please feel encouraged
to pass it along through [through
Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432) in the **lab06**
folder. We’ll give some class participation credit for useful
suggestions.

## Why do it?

Successful completion of this assignment will result in a 5 to 10 point
bonus for your course lab grade, depending on how robust your work is.

-   If your site works, and accomplishes the general goal of getting a
    little bit of your work “out there” in a reasonable way, that’s all
    we’re looking for.
-   There’s no need to include all of the things that are possible.
-   We’d be very happy with a modest meaningful step in the right
    direction.
-   Something that works for you is definitely the way to go - if that
    means using something other than RStudio to do the work, so be it.
-   There’s also no need to spend any money to make this happen,
    although if you want to purchase a domain name of your own, they are
    available (for instance through Google Domains) very cheaply (under
    ten dollars per year).

## Reviewing Your Work

The TAs will be happy to review your work on Lab 06 at any time from now
up through 2021-05-01, and they will try to provide suggestions for
improvements. You can also ask questions [through
Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432) in the **lab06**
folder.

Again, we’re not going to talk about this much (if at all) in class, and
so you’re a little more on your own here to try to get something working
than for the other Labs.

## Submitting the Lab

Submit Lab 06 by sending the link of your website (and any special
information you want to pass along) to Dr. Love via email with the
subject line: `Lab 06: My Website` by the deadline specified on [the
Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

While this is an individual assignment, if you want to work together as
a group to help each other get a website up and running, that would be
terrific.
