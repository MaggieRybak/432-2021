# Lab 06

This is the main page for Lab 06 for the 432 course in Spring 2021.

Deadlines for all Labs are provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Instructions

The instructions for completing Lab 06 [are available now](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06_instructions.md).

Unlike the other Labs, this Lab is optional, and does not rely on any of the materials we'll provide in class, so you can build it at any time during the semester. 

Submit your Lab 06 via email, [as the instructions suggest](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06_instructions.md), at any time up to the deadline.
