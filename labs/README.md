## Grading

See [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html) for details on how grading works on Labs.

## Grading Errors and Regrade Requests

The Lab Regrade Request Form is now available at http://bit.ly/432-2021-lab-regrade-requests. This is how we handle all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. 

- Essentially, if you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of our first five Labs, fill out [the Regrade Request Form](http://bit.ly/432-2021-lab-regrade-requests) anytime before 2021-05-14 at Noon. 
- In mid-May, Dr. Love will then open [the form](http://bit.ly/432-2021-lab-regrade-requests). If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
- Visit [the Assignments and Grading section of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html) for more details on this policy.

The [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html) also provides a link to the Lab Regrade Request Form and its associated deadline (2021-05-14 at noon).
